# Human-Machine-Interface
This is a Human machinr interface project for our Embedded systems module. 
In this project we will do the following: 
1. Create a 16x2 LCD display to show readings from a humidity and temperature sensor. You can choose to connect these sensors using either I2C or ADC interfaces.

2. Utilize four buttons: two for adjusting temperature limits and two for humidity limits. This allows you to set upper and lower bounds for temperature and humidity.

3. Include LEDs or a buzzer as indicators. These will signal an alert if the temperature or humidity goes beyond the configured limits set by the buttons.

In essence, it's a system that monitors and displays temperature and humidity data, lets you set acceptable limits with buttons, and uses LEDs or a buzzer to alert you if the readings go outside those limits.
