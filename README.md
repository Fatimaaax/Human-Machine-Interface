# Human-Machine-Interface
Welcome to the Human Machine Interface (HMI) project developed for our Embedded Systems module. This project is designed to bridge the gap between humans and machines, allowing for intuitive interaction and real-time monitoring of environmental conditions.

In the context of this project, we are combining hardware and software to create a practical system that not only gathers data but also provides a user-friendly interface for controlling and understanding that data. Here's a brief overview of the key features and components of our HMI project:

- LCD Display: We have implemented a 16x2 LCD display that serves as the visual interface, showing real-time readings from an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) sensor. The LDR sensor provides valuable insights into light intensity, offering a flexible and adaptable component for various applications.

- Interactive Control: To make the system truly interactive, we've incorporated four buttons - two for adjusting light intensity thresholds and two for controlling other system features. This setup allows users to set upper and lower bounds for the light levels and customize system behavior.

- Alert Mechanism: Safety and monitoring are essential aspects of our project. To this end, we've integrated LEDs or a buzzer as alert indicators. These components will immediately notify you if the light levels go beyond the predefined limits set by the adjustment buttons.

Our HMI project provides a complete solution for monitoring and displaying crucial environmental data while offering user-driven control over acceptable light levels. The combination of the LCD display, interactive buttons, and alert mechanisms makes this system a valuable tool for a variety of applications, from automating lighting systems to ensuring safety in specific light conditions.

This GitHub repository serves as a hub for our project, offering all the necessary documentation, source code, and hardware setup instructions. We invite you to explore, contribute, and utilize this project to enhance your understanding of embedded systems and human-machine interaction.

Let's embark on this journey of merging technology and usability to create a more connected and informed world, with a focus on light-sensitive applications.

## Design

## Hardware Setup Instructions 

**What You Need:**

- A 16x2 LCD display (a small screen).
- A light sensor called an LDR.
- Four buttons (two for adjusting light, two for other things).
- Some small lights (LEDs) or a buzzer to make noise.
- A computer board like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
- Wires and a breadboard.
- A power source like batteries or a USB charger.
- Some tiny parts called resistors for the buttons and LDR.


**Setting It Up:**

1. Connect the LCD Display:

   - Attach the LCD screen to your computer board using wires. Make sure you connect the power and data pins correctly.

2. Hook Up the Light Sensor (LDR):

   - Wire the LDR to your computer board. One end should be connected to power, and the other to a special input. Use a resistor to make it work better.

3. Connect the Buttons:

   - Plug in the four buttons to your computer board. Two are for changing light settings, and two do other things. Don't forget to use the resistors to connect them properly.

4. Add Alert Lights or a Buzzer:

   - Connect some small lights or a buzzer to your computer board. These will show or make sounds when the light changes.\
     
5. Power It Up:

   - Make sure your setup gets power. You can use batteries or a USB charger, depending on what you have.

6. Load the Code:

   - Write and load the code onto your computer board. The code should tell the board to read the LDR sensor, listen to the buttons, and control the lights or buzzer based on your instructions.

7. Test It:

   - Try your project. Check if the LCD screen shows the light level. Use the buttons to set when the lights or buzzer should turn on if the light gets too bright or too dark.
Optional:

8. Put It in a Box:

   - If you want, you can put your setup in a box or some protection to use it neatly.
